# Numerical-Computing
It has solution of 5 Numerical Methods for Solving Nonlinear Equations which are Bisection method, Regular Falsi method, Simple fixed point iteration, Newton Raphson Method and Secant Method. The first two methods are closed interval whereas the other remaining are open interval method. 

Bisection Method: 
Equation: e^-x(3.2sin(x)-0.5cos(x))
Output:
